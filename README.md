# Islelib

Islelib is Illuscio's python Library template. "Isle" is the naming convention
for Illuscio code, chosen for its auditory similarity to "I-L" ("AYE_ELL"), as
opposed to illib which would be phonetically sounded out as "ill".

Islelib comes pre-built with a number of tools for formatting, linting and 
testing.
